# COBOL-Calculator (Operation ThunderSnatch)
A simple COBOL calculator for practice as an introduction to the language. Nothing fancy.

The options for how to calculate things are displayed out for the user. 

Resulting calculation is a little unsightly, may come back and tweak the data items to change how many numbers are displayed as well as where the decimal point is located.
